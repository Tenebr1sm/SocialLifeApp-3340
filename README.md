For CSCI-3340
Project ideas:
**(General social media features)**
1.	Put a shared calendar feature to schedule hang outs
2.	Status update feature
3.	where people can add their own birthdays on their profile and can add each other.


**Birthday Reminder App - (Cake Day!)**
-	App where people can add their own birthdays on their profile and can add each other. It will feature user profiles, a friend system, bulletin board, calendar, and more. Those who sign up will be connected to a database, and whoever shares the same birthday will be added to your shared birthday list. It will show a list of all the people you share a birthday with, but you can also add people by searching them up like your friends by their usernames. Then you can see their birthdays, and you can set a reminder whenever their birthday comes up. Whenever it is someoneâ€™s birthday from your friends list, you can send a prewritten birthday message to them or write your own message.
