# SocialLifeApp-3340
For CSCI-3340

**Birthday Reminder App - (Cake Day!)**
-	App where people can add their own birthdays on their profile and can add each other. It will feature user profiles, a friend system, bulletin board, calendar, and more. Those who sign up will be connected to a database, and whoever shares the same birthday will be added to your shared birthday list. It will show a list of all the people you share a birthday with, but you can also add people by searching them up like your friends by their usernames. Then you can see their birthdays, and you can set a reminder whenever their birthday comes up. Whenever it is someoneâ€™s birthday from your friends list, you can send a prewritten birthday message to them or write your own message.

# Questions
Below is a list of questions to be addressed as a result of reviewing this design document 
 - "Do I have to put in my real name?"  Nobody is obligated to put their real name, but for the sake of adding others such as your friends, you can put your real name but it will only be visible to those who have you added and not to the public.
