### For CSCI-3340  

## 🎂 Birthday Reminder App – *"Cake Day!"*

App where people can add their own birthdays on their profile and connect with others.  
The app follows the **CRUD convention** — users can **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** data such as profiles, friends, calendar events, forum posts, and more.  

Those who sign up will be connected to a shared **database**, and anyone who shares the same birthday will be added to your **shared birthday list**.  
It will show a list of all the people you share a birthday with, but you can also **add people** by searching their usernames.  
You can then see their birthdays, set **reminders**, and when it’s someone’s birthday from your friends list, you can send a **prewritten** or **custom message** to celebrate.
